<p>Now, I gotta set one thing straight 'cause the story's been blown up beyond any similarity to actual events. I never would've ejected if it wouldn't've made a difference. I'm not a sucker for lost causes. I'm lucky I didn't get waxed, and even luckier Felix<sup><a class="footnote-reference" href="#1" id='back1'>1</a></sup> didn't either. It was the right decision at the right time, even though it breaks all the rules.</p>

<p>Nine hundred ninety nine times of a thousand, ejecting in the middle of battle is the wrong move. Your mech, apart from carrying a load of delightful incendiaries and enough sensors to overwhelm most launch pad mission controllers, is heavily armored and equipped with a load of life support gear that'd sustain a small spaceship crew. I don't recommed stepping into a hostile environment without one.</p>

<p>Copper Flats was somewhere between "the Zsondári desert" and "nuke blast zone" on the hostile environment scale. The whole operation went sideways right at the start. Anti-spacecraft batteries opened fire as soon as we dropped into orbit; the outfit responsible for disarming them never even showed up. Collected their checks and were never heard from again.</p>

<p>This forced the pilots to do some 'creative navigating' to get us to the drop zones. Accounts after the fact agree that the stick jockeys were only moderately successful at pulling that stunt. I don't blame them a bit. I can't imagine it &mdash; making calculations to get us boots across unfathomable miles of vaccuum without plowing through some random asteroid and scattering our atoms across two lightyears of space &mdash; only to drop out of plus<sup><a class="footnote-reference" href="#2" id='back2'>2</a></sup> in a hail of bullets that weren't supposed to be there. Not the sort of surprise I enjoy when showing up to the office. Naw, I blame the hosers who didn't do the job they were paid for.</p>

<p>We hit dirt more than a few klicks out of position, which prevented the unit leaders from contacting each other and coordinating things. Before you could cough twice, it was every company for itself and our single concern became survival rather than causing a little contractual mayhem.</p>

<p>Survival was going to be tough if the lifeboats couldn't get to us, and our recovery location happened to be defended by a mag shield that was still operating. 'S a lot of metal in a lifeboat and the pilot'd be a tad miffed if he came careening in to save the day only to get bounced a couple mountain ranges over off that shield. So that's what I told sarge.</p>

<p>Except he never answered. If I'd'a been paying attention to the HUD I'd've known he wasn't there, his glowy dot was nowhere to be found. Neither was the LT. Or the Cap. Of the 200 or so boots I dropped into the flats with, my HUD was only picking up 75, and none of my superiors were in the group. The radio squawked non-stop with calls from hysterical boots to officers who never made it to the ground. Terrified kids asking for instructions, endangering their lives by making a pile of noise and standing still.</p>

<p>I jumped into the next radio pause. "All ya'll who plan on dying, just keep on bleating like a flock of panicked lambs. The rest of you, <strong>shut your maws.</strong>" The silence that followed betrayed the training these boots'd had; when given a direct order, they obeyed. "We're a bunch of strangers to each other at the moment, but our survival depends on working together. The lifeboat'll be here in the neighborhood of 18 minutes, and her destination is currently underneath a mag. If we want to get home we gotta get that shield down and set up a defensive perimeter around the recovery zone."</p>

<p>Another pause. Good, they were listening. Time to get deployed. We'd each been parked on the same bit of dirt we landed on for over two minutes, and every second not moving was a chance for our hosts to get a bead. A mech might be armored, but a ground artillery crew's got enough boom at their disposal to send any boot home in a box.</p>

<p>I got on the horn again. "The RZ<sup><a class="footnote-reference" href="#3" id='back3'>3</a></sup> is a meadow next to the stream on the west side of the town we were supposed to flatten. The shield generator is somewhere in town, along with a battery or two of ground artillery. We'll have to take them all out to even have a chance of getting off this rock. It'll take three teams. One to take out the shield generator, and two to hunt down whatever batteries are hiding in town."</p>

<p>I made a circle around one-third of the dots on my HUD. "I'll take this group from the north and start looking for batteries." Making a circle around the other two groups I said, "I need a volunteer to lead each of these."</p>

<p>The volunteer for the east section piped up before there was even a pause, "I'll get the mag, Cap.  Name's Ito. Tasha Ito."</p>

<p>"I'm not a captain, but thanks, Ito. Shouldn't be too hard to find. Mag that size drinks a lot of power, so there's likely to be a sizeable sub-station nearby. Let us know when you find it, it's liable to have folk parked nearby to keep strangers like us from poking about. You'll be Green Group. Still needing someone to lead the other half of our capture-the-flag double-team."</p>

<p>One of the southern dots squawked, "I'll head that up and meet you in the center of town, Cap. Can we be red?  I always liked red."</p>

<p>"Go get, 'em Red, but I'm no captain."</p>

<p>"Looks like that's probably changed." It was a flattering remark, but liable to get me killed wasting time in self-adulation. Mechs move. That's a big part of how we generate so much confusion. And stay alive. So I got back on the radio, "We got jobs to do, let's hop. My group's Black." Eleven minutes left.</p>

<p>Red Group's volunteer leader was called Hank. He spoke quickly and with a drawl. We coordinated a house-to-house search for any missile battery that could give our rescue boat trouble. I would've loved to hire him after the Flats; he was good. Quick on his feet, and did a good job with the sweep. Only lost seven guys, which was fantastic considering the circumstances (I lost nine). The missle campers had a head start on us. Their ironic disadvantage was being weighed down by missles; they couldn't move fast and gave up their position with every launch. Once we had them dialed in, it was just a matter of closing the distance before they could get a shot off and rabbit away. Shame it cost us sixteen guys.</p>

<p>Miss Ito was dealing with a troop of mechs who had a lot more creativity at their disposal. Once Hank and I'd mopped up the missle campers we headed her direction. At which point she promptly disappeared from the HUD. Couldn't raise her on the radio either. That meant one of two things: one, she'd eaten a missle, or two, she'd been hit by a DEMP<sup><a class="footnote-reference" href="#4" id='back4'>4</a></sup>. Lifeboat was due in six minutes.</p>

<p>"Green Group, someone fill me in," I said.</p>

<p>"Ito got demped."


Mini drone<sup><a class="footnote-reference" href="#4" id='back4'>4</a></sup> had his number, got him right before the rescue boat sounding the callback.

	<li>I call my mech Felix now. It's usually considered bad luck to re-christen a ride, but Felix is apparently the exception that proves the rule. He's been luckier ever since.<a id='1' href='#back1' class='footnote-backreference'>&uarr;</a></li>
   <li>Plus-lightspeed. Faster than 2.99&times;10<sup>8</sup>m &frasl; s<a id='2' href='#back2' class='footnote-backreference'>&uarr;</a></li>

   <li>Directed Electromagnetic Pulse. These have the nasty effect of toasting every piece of electronics they hit. A mech hit with an EMP usually becomes a coffin.<a id='4' href='#back4' class='footnote-backreference'>&uarr;</a></li>

Battle of Copper Flats. In the middle of one battle, his side was falling all around him. 
There were no officers left so he took charge.  He personally left the safety of his mech (risking both his life,
and his mech's safety.  Rescued Tasha. No one ejects during a battle.  Ever.) to accomplish the final part of his plan to win the battle.
Once the battle was over, he returned to his 'garage' to find over 20 mechs wanting to serve under his command, so he created
a his own unit and struck out on his own.  Now soldiers in bars tell stories they've heard 2nd- and 3rd-hand about the battle of Copper Flats. 
Those who were there are treated with respect and admiration.
