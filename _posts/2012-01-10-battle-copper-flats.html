Battle of Copper Flats.  In the middle of one battle, his side was falling all around him.  There were no officers left so he took charge.  He personally left the safety of his mech (risking both his life, and his mech's safety.  Rescued Tasha. No one ejects during a battle.  Ever.) to accomplish the final part of his plan to win the battle.   Once the battle was over, he returned to his 'garage' to find over 20 mechs wanting to serve under his command, so he created a his own unit and struck out on his own.  Now soldiers in bars tell stories they've heard 2nd- and 3rd-hand about the battle of Copper Flats.  Those who were there are treated with respect and admiration.
