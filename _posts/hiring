<p>Most mercenary outfits will hire any pilot with a mech who wants in. It's hard to blame them; that kind of heavy equipment is hard to come by, and I don't know of a company that can't use the guns. But hiring pilots helter-skelter buys you the command of a helter-skelter unit. I'd rather my pilots have demonstrated a certain kind of character; the kind you don't find much in mercenaries. I don't have a name for it, and it tends to hide behind the veteran's swaggering bravado.</p>

<p>Starting out, it was just me 'n' Flint. Flint's the perfect example of what I'm talking about. Doesn't jump to conclusions, but makes quick decisions on the field. Drinks like a fish, but is the first one to the gym the next morning. To my knowledge, he's never lost even a single hand-to-hand bout.. I'm almost certain his story about single-handedly taking out that platoon on New Kansas is either grossly overstated or entirely fabricated, probably because he only tells it when he's drunk. He cares about the men under his command in 'A' company. He cares a lot. And they know it; they'd follow him down the gullet of Hades and swim the Styx to bring back Cerberus' heads. You don't find these guys just by hiring whomever shows up at your door.</p>
