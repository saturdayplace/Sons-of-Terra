        <p class='meta'>by Xander</p>
        <p>There was no civil war<sup><a class="footnote-reference" href="#1"              id='back1'>1</a></sup> to precipitate the transfer of power from the governments to the corporations.  The
                transition happened gradually.  Government increasingly granted power to corporations until it was unable to stop their abuses.  The corporations started   behaving like governments;
                creating agreements with or sanctions against remnants of foreign     powers or with other companies, levying taxes on the populations under their control.   Their most obvious step
                towards statehood was the hiring of freelance mechanized armies. The  mech armies could be trusted right up to the minute their contract expired.  They     were fiercely loyal to the
                current employer, and could be counted on without question, but once  the contact expired that loyalty was up for sale.</p>

        <p>Society devolved.  Because the corporations and the mech armies looked out only for themselves, no one looked after the needs of the public.  Roads not in use   by the corporations
                fell into disrepair.  Interplanetary travel stopped for everyone      except corporates who used their company's cruisers, or mechs who could provide their own.  Jails, courts, police,
                the entire justice apparatus simply ceased to exist.  Populations     were left to fend for themselves.  Some people banded together, working in ways       similar to pre-historic native
                Earth cultures, dividing labor between those who could make/repair,   those who could hunt/gather, and those who could farm.  These groups grew insular,    viewing outsiders as a
                potential threat to their precious resources. Others became nomads,   following herds of wild animals, or simply preferring solitude to the inevitable      politics involved with a group
                of humans.   These were distrusted by any community they came into    contact with.  Corporates referred to anyone making it on their own - either          community or nomad - as a wildling.</p>

        <p>Corporations typically left the wildlings to themselves, except for when   they needed laborers for factories or plantations.  When the need arose, they'd       commission a mech troop
                to round up people like so many horses.  Obviously, wildlings became  mistrustful of mech pilots, even when they meant no harm.  On the other hand, they    couldn't help but envy the
                easy lifestyle mechs seemed to live.</p>

 <p>Corporations stopped competing in terms of market share, and started less  abstract contentions.  A corporation hired freelance troops to protect its interest,  in say an oil field
                or a thorium mine.  Eventually, maps of the system became similar to  Earth's colonial counterparts, when European nations held territories all over the    globe, each subject to its
                conqueror. Mech troops were typically paid to ensure that there was a local population capable of doing the hard manual labor required by the nature of the territory, usually
                working a mine or factory.  These laborers were de facto serfs.  They had no hope for freedom, owned 'only their bellies', and relied on benevolent mech    troops for protection from
                predatory wildlings.</p>

        <p>This is the story of how I decided to change all that.</p>
