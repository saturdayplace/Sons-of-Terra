<p>Now, I gotta set one things straight: I never would've ejected if it wouldn't've made a
   difference.  I'm not a sucker for lost causes. I'm lucky I didn't get waxed, and even
   luckier Felix<a class="footnote-reference" href="#1" id='back1'><sup>1</sup></a>
   didn't either.  I wouldn't be much today with a good ride. You can have Felix when you
   extract my smoking husk from his.</p>

<p>And it wasn't no damnded heroic gesture either.  It was the right decision at the right time,
   even though it breaks all the rules. That's the mark of a good officer, knowing when your
   situation calls for following the rules, and when it doesn't.</p>

	<li>I call my mech Felix now. It's usually considered bad luck to re-christen a ride, but Felix is apparently the exception that proves the rule.<a id='1' href='#back1' class='footnote-backreference'>&uarr;</a></li>

Battle of Copper Flats.  In the middle of one battle, his side was falling all around him. 
There were no officers left so he took charge.  He personally left the safety of his mech (risking both his life,
and his mech's safety.  Rescued Tasha. No one ejects during a battle.  Ever.) to accomplish the final part of his plan to win the battle.
Once the battle was over, he returned to his 'garage' to find over 20 mechs wanting to serve under his command, so he created
a his own unit and struck out on his own.  Now soldiers in bars tell stories they've heard 2nd- and 3rd-hand about the battle of Copper Flats. 
Those who were there are treated with respect and admiration.
