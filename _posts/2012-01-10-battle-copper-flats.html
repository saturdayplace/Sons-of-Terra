<p>Now, I gotta set one things straight: I never would've ejected if it wouldn't've made a
   difference.  I'm not a sucker for lost causes. I'm lucky I didn't get waxed, and even
   luckier Felix<a class="footnote-reference" href="#1" id='back1'><sup>1</sup></a>
   didn't either. It was the right decision at the right time, even though it
   breaks all the rules.</p>

<p>Nine hundred ninety nine times of a thousand, ejecting in the middle of battle
   is the wrong move.  Your mech, apart from carrying a load of delightful incendiaries
   and enough sensors to overwhelm most launch pad mission controllers, is heavily
   armored and equipped with enough life support gear to sustain small spaceship
   crew. I don't recommed stepping into a hostile environment without one; mech battles
   aren't typically supportive and nurturing environments.

<p>Copper Flats was somewhere between "the Zsondári desert" and "nuke blast zone"
   on the supportive and nurturing environment scale. The whole operation went
   sideways right at the start.</p>

Battle of Copper Flats.  In the middle of one battle, his side was falling all around him. 
There were no officers left so he took charge.  He personally left the safety of his mech (risking both his life,
and his mech's safety.  Rescued Tasha. No one ejects during a battle.  Ever.) to accomplish the final part of his plan to win the battle.
Once the battle was over, he returned to his 'garage' to find over 20 mechs wanting to serve under his command, so he created
a his own unit and struck out on his own.  Now soldiers in bars tell stories they've heard 2nd- and 3rd-hand about the battle of Copper Flats. 
Those who were there are treated with respect and admiration.
