<p>Most mercenary outfits will hire any pilot with a mech who wants in. It's hard to blame them; that kind of heavy equipment is hard to come by, and I don't know of a company that can't use the guns. But hiring pilots helter-skelter buys you the command of a helter-skelter unit. I'd rather my pilots have demonstrated a certain kind of character; the kind you don't find much in mercenaries. I don't have a name for it, and it tends to hide behind the veteran's swaggering bravado.</p>

<p>Starting out, it was just me and Flint. Flint's the perfect example of what I'm talking about. Doesn't jump to conclusions, but makes quick decisions on the field. Drinks like a fish, but is the first one to the gym the next morning. To my knowledge, he's never lost even a single hand-to-hand bout.. I'm almost certain his story about single-handedly taking out that platoon on New Kansas is either grossly overstated or entirely fabricated, probably because he only tells it when he's drunk. He cares about the men under his command in 'A' company. He cares a lot. And they know it; they'd follow him down the gullet of Hades and swim the Styx to bring back Cerberus' heads. You don't find these guys just by hiring whomever shows up at your door.</p>

<p>And after Copper Flats, a mass of misguided or misbegotten miscreants streamed through the door. Most of the companies involved didn't have any real leadership remaining after that battle, and that has an effect on the younger ranks. Much as they all like to think they'd do better calling the shots, much as they brag to each other over drinks about what they'll do when their "turn comes," when given the chance most folk'll back away. It's intimidating to stare right in the face of real responsibility. Most of the companies involved in the Flats just lamely fell apart aftwards as the youth drifted to places they could count on. The middle ranks from those outfits &mdash; guys who'd be non-coms in a conventional army &mdash; were left stranded without a place to work.</p> 

<p>The day after the Flats Flint and I were doing some maintenance on our rides in the Titan's garage when a pair of these vets showed up and asked for a job. Neither of us was in a position to speak on behalf of the Titans. We weren't even sure the Titans existed anymore as a corporate entity, but figured that since no one was kicking us out of the garage we might as well get some use out of it. "You oughta go ask at the office," I told them.</p>

<p>"There ain't no one in there. Been trying a couple days. Heard you guys back here and thought since there ain't no one in the office ya'll might be in charge." The speaker had dark hair and eyes and looked like he'd probably seen more action that either Flint or myself.</p>

<p>"We're not even sure if there's anything left to be in charge of."</p>

<p>"This garage looks like it might be one."
