<p>Now, I gotta set one things straight: I never would've ejected if it wouldn't've made a
   difference.  I'm not a sucker for lost causes. I'm lucky I didn't get waxed, and even
   luckier Felix<sup><a class="footnote-reference" href="#1" id='back1'>1</a></sup>
   didn't either. It was the right decision at the right time, even though it
   breaks all the rules.</p>

<p>Nine hundred ninety nine times of a thousand, ejecting in the middle of battle
   is the wrong move.  Your mech, apart from carrying a load of delightful incendiaries
   and enough sensors to overwhelm most launch pad mission controllers, is heavily
   armored and equipped with enough life support gear to sustain small spaceship
   crew. I don't recommed stepping into a hostile environment without one; mech battles
   aren't typically supportive and nurturing environments.

<p>Copper Flats was somewhere between "the Zsondári desert" and "nuke blast zone"
   on the supportive and nurturing environment scale. The whole operation went
   sideways right at the start. The anti-spacecraft batteries opened fire as soon
   as we dropped into orbit (the outfit responsible for disarming them never even
   showed up.  Collected their checks and were never heard from again).</p>

<p>This forced the pilots to do some 'creative navigating' to get us to the drop zones.
   Accounts from the ground after the fact agree that the jockeys were only moderately successful at pulling that stunt. I don't blame them a bit.  I can't imagine the calculations they gotta make getting us boots across unfathomable miles of vaccuum without plowing through some random asteroid and scattering our atoms across two lightyears of space, only to drop out of plus<sup><a class="footnote-reference" href="#2" id='back2'>2</a></sup> in a hail of bullets.</p>

Battle of Copper Flats.  In the middle of one battle, his side was falling all around him. 
There were no officers left so he took charge.  He personally left the safety of his mech (risking both his life,
and his mech's safety.  Rescued Tasha. No one ejects during a battle.  Ever.) to accomplish the final part of his plan to win the battle.
Once the battle was over, he returned to his 'garage' to find over 20 mechs wanting to serve under his command, so he created
a his own unit and struck out on his own.  Now soldiers in bars tell stories they've heard 2nd- and 3rd-hand about the battle of Copper Flats. 
Those who were there are treated with respect and admiration.
